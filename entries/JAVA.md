Java is a **versatile**, *object-oriented* programming language designed to run on any platform that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is widely used for building **enterprise applications**, **mobile apps** (especially Android), and large-scale backend systems. With its strong typing, portability, and vast ecosystem of libraries, Java remains one of the most reliable and in-demand programming languages in the world.
