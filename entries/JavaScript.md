# JavaScript

JavaScript is a **high-level**, *interpreted* programming language that allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It runs directly in the browser, enabling features such as form validation, animations, and real-time content updates. With the rise of frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, and **Angular**, JavaScript has become one of the most essential languages for modern web development.
